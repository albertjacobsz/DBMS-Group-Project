# DBMS-Group-Project

The final group project developed for the Course COMP2411 at PolyU in which we have been tasked to develop a database system for a problem.
Our group decided to create a software which allows Doctors to see the appointments they have with their respective clients. Furthermore said
doctors are able to also change the status of their client's medications. For example, a client can either be IN PROGRESS of taking medications
or FINISHED with taking medications. Clients on the other hand are able to create an appointment with their doctor of choice on a specific date
and time. However, if the doctor already has an appointment at that time, the website will not show the doctor.
